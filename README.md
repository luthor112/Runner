# Runner
A game where you avoid obstacles in a never-ending corridor

This was my old Game Development homework, using MonoGame.

The game goes ever faster, with your current score in the top left.

**Bug on exit!** Press Alt-F4 to close the window, then use Task Manager to kill the process.

Controls:

- Use A and D to move left and right
- Use W and S to jump and duck
- Click on targets for a point bonus
